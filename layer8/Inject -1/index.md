# **Weekly Assignment \-1: Blog/Website**

This is the first inject assigned by Jeffrey. An “inject” is a technical write-up assignment.

This inject was pretty straightforward as it was just following a few steps. The task as mentioned in the title, is creating a website using quarto. More information regarding quarto can be found in the info directory on this website.

I used this guide: [https://moonpiedumplings.github.io/talks/self-site/](https://moonpiedumplings.github.io/talks/self-site/)

The instructions for making the website are as follows:

## **Setup**

* Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and create an account  
  * Your site will be located at “username.github.io”  
* Go to [github.com/moonpiedumplings/blog-template](https://github.com/moonpiedumplings/blog-template) and select “use template”  
  * The repo name should be “username.github.io”  
  * make sure to select “include all branches”  
  * in the github settings, make sure “gh-pages” is selected as the deploy

Since I don’t use github often it took me a bit to find the “gh-pages” setting. I did some research and found it was under the “Pages” tab in the repository settings.

After I got everything setup, I started toying around with the quarto.yml file and markdown. Using quarto and markdown makes the process of editing a website extremely intuitive (I don’t know web development). Once I figured out the structure of the website, I set up multiple directories like Layer 8 and my resume.
