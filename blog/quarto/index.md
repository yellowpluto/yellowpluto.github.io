Quarto is the static site generator used to render this site.

It's [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) is very extensive, and worth reading.


Interesting/Important bits:

Quarto has a built in [category system](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#categories)

This enables users to filter documents by types. 

Theming: <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html>

At the top right of this page, there is a toggle between light and dark theme. You can edit the `_quarto.yml` file to edit the themes used.

Plugins/Extensions: <https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/>

Plugins add functionality to quarto, like being able to embed QR Codes. 


Web based slides: <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/>

I used Reveal JS slides for the [presentation](https://moonpiedumplings.github.io/talks/self-site/presentation.html)


Under the hood, Quarto uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and supports all of it's features.
